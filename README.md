#🗾 Country Code To Emoji Flag 🇦🇺🇦🇱🇧🇪🇫🇷🇩🇰🇵🇱🇺🇦🇬🇧🇺🇸
Converts string of country codes to string of emoji flags. As an argument use a single 2-letter country code or a string of multiple codes.

##❓ Why Emoji
Emoji symbol is a replacement for an image file. The image file is already present at your intended destination (a person's device), so why would you transmit the image to them again and again? -- Use emoji!

##♻ Green Technology
An image file equivalent to an emoji symbol may be tens, hundreds of kilobytes in size, while an emoji symbol is only several bytes. That's a bandwidth saving of around 10,000 times. If you use emoji instead of image files, you reduce your carbon footprint.

##🗒 Plain Text Is Now 🆒 Faux Rich Text
Now you can include emoji in plain text files, even in plain text emails, making them sharp, colourful and rich looking.

```php
require 'flagmaster.class.php';

# Single flag
echo flagMaster::emojiFlag('uk'); # 🇬🇧

# String of multiple flags
echo flagMaster::emojiFlag('ukcwsxap'); # 🇬🇧🇳🇱🇳🇱🏴
